const guideText = `# Vex Agent Guide

Vex is a spec-driven test coverage auditor. You write a spec describing
intended behaviors, then vex checks whether your tests cover them.

## Core Concept
The spec is the source of truth — not the code. Write the spec from the
task description BEFORE or DURING implementation. NEVER write a spec by
reading existing code.

## Quick Start

  # Generate spec from task description
  vex spec "Add JWT authentication with login, refresh, and token validation"

  # Validate spec for missing behaviors
  vex validate

  # Check test coverage
  vex check

  # Read results (stdout may be truncated — always read the file)
  cat .vex/report.json

## Spec Format

The spec lives at .vex/vexspec.yaml. All paths are absolute from project root.

  project: MyApp
  description: |
    One-line project description.

  shared:
    - name: error-handling
      description: |
        Behaviors that apply across multiple sections.

  sections:
    - name: Auth
      path: internal/auth
      description: |
        JWT authentication module.
      shared: [error-handling]
      behaviors:
        - name: login
          description: |
            POST /login accepts credentials.
            Returns JWT on success. Returns 401 on invalid credentials.
      subsections:
        - name: Token Refresh
          file: internal/auth/refresh.go
          behaviors:
            - name: refresh
              description: |
                POST /refresh returns new access token.

## Scoping Sections to Code

Use "path" for directories (walks for all source and test files):
  path: internal/auth                      # single directory
  path: [internal/auth, internal/session]  # multiple directories

Use "file" for specific files (classified as source or test automatically):
  file: hn_jobs.py                         # single file
  file: [src/auth.py, tests/test_auth.py]  # source + test files

Both work on sections and subsections. You can combine them:
  path: tests/           # walk for test files
  file: src/auth.py      # just this source file

Vex auto-detects all languages in a directory and discovers files across
all of them. For multi-language projects (e.g., Rust + CUDA), all source
and test files are found regardless of language.

Files listed under "file" are classified as source or test using language
patterns (e.g., test_*.py, *_test.go). This works with any project layout:

  # Tests alongside source
  file: [auth.py, test_auth.py]

  # Separate test directory
  file: [src/auth.py, tests/test_auth.py]

  # Walk a directory + specific files
  path: tests/
  file: [src/auth.py, src/session.py]

Key rules:
- "path" walks a directory tree for all matching files
- "file" includes exactly the files listed (no walking)
- subsections use "path" or "file", not both
- shared behaviors are referenced by name in a section's "shared" list
- both "path" and "file" accept a string or list: "path: foo" or "path: [foo, bar]"

## Covered Overrides

Mark behaviors as covered without sending them to the LLM. Use this for
behaviors tested via cross-process boundaries (e2e binary spawns, FFI,
IPC) that vex cannot trace through source code.

  sections:
    - name: Worker
      path: src/worker
      covered:
        - behavior: serve-loop
          reason: tested via e2e binary spawn in tests/e2e/worker_test.rs
        - behavior: heartbeat
          reason: tested via integration test that spawns coordinator + worker
      behaviors:
        - name: serve-loop
          description: ...
        - name: heartbeat
          description: ...

Covered behaviors appear as covered in the report with the reason as
the detail. They are excluded from LLM analysis, saving cost and time.
Both "behavior" and "reason" are required fields.

## Dismissed Suggestions

Suppress validate suggestions you've decided to skip. Use this when
vex validate flags a behavior as missing but you've intentionally
excluded it. Dismissed suggestions are filtered from output and do
not count toward incomplete status.

  sections:
    - name: Auth
      path: src/auth
      dismissed:
        - suggestion: logout
          reason: handled by session manager, not auth module
        - suggestion: token-revocation
          reason: out of scope — planned for v2
      behaviors:
        - name: login
          description: ...

Both "suggestion" and "reason" are required fields. The "suggestion"
value matches the "behavior_name" from the validation suggestion.
Adding or removing a dismissed entry changes the section checksum,
triggering revalidation on the next drift-aware run.

## Writing Behaviors

A behavior IS:
- One observable external behavior with input -> output
- Error cases included inline: "Returns 401 on invalid credentials"
- Side effects stated: "Writes session to database"
- A mathematical formula or equation that the code must implement correctly

A behavior is NOT:
- A data structure ("Report contains these fields")
- An interface definition ("Provider must implement Complete()")
- A list of values ("Supports Go, Python, Java")
- Implementation details ("Uses bcrypt for hashing")

Be specific: "returns 401" not "handles errors". Use kebab-case names.

## Formulas and Equations

When a behavior involves a formula, include the formula directly in the
description. Vex will verify that tests assert mathematical correctness
(known inputs/outputs, boundary conditions, convergence properties),
not just that the function runs without error.

Example:

  behaviors:
    - name: geometric-brownian-motion
      description: |
        Simulates asset price paths using GBM.
        S(t+dt) = S(t) * exp((mu - sigma^2/2)*dt + sigma*sqrt(dt)*Z)
        where Z ~ N(0,1). Must reproduce expected drift and volatility
        over large sample sizes.
    - name: black-scholes-call
      description: |
        Computes European call option price.
        C = S*N(d1) - K*e^(-rT)*N(d2)
        d1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + sigma^2/2)*T) / (sigma*sqrt(T))
        d2 = d1 - sigma*sqrt(T)
        Must match known analytical values for standard inputs.

## Understanding Reports

### Check Report (.vex/report.json)

  {
    "behaviors_checked": 10,
    "gaps": [
      {
        "behavior": "login",
        "detail": "No test for invalid credentials returning 401",
        "suggestion": "TestLoginInvalidCredentials401"
      }
    ],
    "covered": [
      {
        "behavior": "login",
        "detail": "Valid credentials return JWT",
        "test_file": "auth_test.go",
        "test_name": "TestLoginSuccess"
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total_behaviors": 10,
      "fully_covered": 7,
      "gaps_found": 5
    }
  }

A behavior can appear in BOTH gaps and covered (partial coverage).
"fully_covered" counts behaviors in covered but NOT in gaps.

### UNSPECIFIED Gaps

If check finds significant code behavior not in the spec, it reports:

  {"behavior": "UNSPECIFIED", "detail": "Rate limiting logic exists but is not in spec"}

Action: add the missing behavior to the spec, then write a test for it.

### Validation Report (.vex/validation.json)

  {
    "complete": false,
    "suggestions": [
      {
        "section": "Auth",
        "behavior_name": "logout",
        "description": "What happens when user logs out",
        "relation": "new"
      }
    ]
  }

"relation" is "new" for missing behaviors or "extends <name>" for
incomplete ones. "remove: not a behavior" flags non-behavioral entries.

## Exit Codes
- 0: clean (no gaps, spec complete)
- 1: gaps or suggestions found
- 2: fatal error (file not found, invalid config)

## Section Sizing

Keep sections under 10 behaviors. Sections are both the concurrency
boundary and the drift boundary — each section runs as its own LLM
call in parallel (for both check and validate), and drift detection
skips entire clean sections.

A large section with many subsections still runs as one LLM call and
drifts as one unit. Splitting into separate sections gives you both
faster checks (parallel LLM calls) and finer drift granularity (only
changed sections are re-checked). If a section grows past 10 behaviors,
prefer splitting into independent sections over adding subsections.

Use subsections when behaviors share the same code paths and must be
evaluated together. Use separate sections when behaviors are independent.

## Workflow

### First time (spec authoring)

1. Receive task description
2. Run: vex spec "description"
3. Edit .vex/vexspec.yaml if needed (add paths, adjust behaviors)
4. Run: vex validate — read .vex/validation.json
5. Address suggestions, repeat step 4 until complete: true

Do NOT manually validate the YAML structure — vex validate checks
that all required fields are present, shared refs are valid, and
behaviors have name+description. Just write the spec and let vex
catch structural issues.

### Implementation loop

6. Update the spec FIRST — add or modify behaviors for the task
7. Run: vex validate — confirm spec is complete
8. Implement code and tests
9. Run: vex check — read .vex/report.json
10. For each gap: write the missing test
11. Repeat steps 9-10 until exit code 0

Always update the spec before writing code. The spec drives what gets
tested — if the spec is stale, vex check won't catch missing coverage
for new functionality.

Drift detection is on by default: vex skips sections where neither the
code files nor the spec content have changed since the last check. Use
"vex check --drift=false" to force a full re-check of all sections.

### Ongoing development

Use validate regularly as you evolve the spec:

  vex validate        # ensure spec is complete
  # fix any suggestions
  vex validate        # confirm complete: true

Then check when tests are ready:

  vex check              # drift detection is on by default
  vex check --drift=false  # force full re-check of all sections

## Adding to an Existing Spec

Append new sections:
  vex spec "Add billing with Stripe integration"

Add behaviors to an existing section:
  vex spec "Add password reset flow" --extend Auth

## Commands
  vex check                          # check (drift detection on by default)
  vex check --section "Name"         # check one section
  vex check --drift=false            # force full re-check
  vex report                         # formatted summary of last check
  vex validate                       # validate spec completeness
  vex spec "description"             # generate spec sections
  vex spec "desc" --extend "Name"    # add to existing section
  vex drift                          # show which sections changed
  vex init                           # create vex.yaml config
  vex lang add rust --test-patterns "*_test.rs" --source-patterns "*.rs"
  vex lang list                      # list available languages
  vex lang remove rust               # remove a configured language
  vex update                         # update to latest version
  vex guide                          # print this guide

## Output Files
- .vex/vexspec.yaml    — project spec (source of truth, committed to git)
- .vex/report.json     — check report (gaps + covered)
- .vex/validation.json — validation results
- .vex/drift.json      — drift detection results

## Installing & Updating

Install (binary — no Go required):
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickw409/vex/main/install.sh | sh

Install (Go toolchain):
  go install github.com/nickw409/vex/cmd/vex@latest

Update to latest:
  vex update

Check current version:
  vex version

Always use "vex update" to update — it detects whether the binary was
installed via Go or curl and uses the correct method automatically.

IMPORTANT: Always read the full report from these files.
Stdout output may be truncated by your environment.
