const guideText = `# Vex Agent Guide

Vex is a spec-driven test coverage auditor. You write a spec describing
intended behaviors, then vex checks whether your tests cover them.

## Core Concept
The spec is the source of truth — not the code. Write the spec from the
task description BEFORE or DURING implementation. NEVER write a spec by
reading existing code.

## Quick Start

  # Generate spec from task description
  vex spec "Add JWT authentication with login, refresh, and token validation"

  # Validate spec for missing behaviors
  vex validate

  # Check test coverage
  vex check

  # Read results (stdout may be truncated — always read the file)
  cat .vex/report.json

## Spec Format

The spec lives at .vex/vexspec.yaml. All paths are absolute from project root.

  project: MyApp
  description: |
    One-line project description.

  shared:
    - name: error-handling
      description: |
        Behaviors that apply across multiple sections.

  sections:
    - name: Auth
      path: internal/auth
      description: |
        JWT authentication module.
      shared: [error-handling]
      behaviors:
        - name: login
          description: |
            POST /login accepts credentials.
            Returns JWT on success. Returns 401 on invalid credentials.
      subsections:
        - name: Token Refresh
          file: internal/auth/refresh.go
          behaviors:
            - name: refresh
              description: |
                POST /refresh returns new access token.

## Scoping Sections to Code

Use "path" for directories (walks for all source and test files):
  path: internal/auth                      # single directory
  path: [internal/auth, internal/session]  # multiple directories

Use "file" for specific files (classified as source or test automatically):
  file: hn_jobs.py                         # single file
  file: [src/auth.py, tests/test_auth.py]  # source + test files

Both work on sections and subsections. You can combine them:
  path: tests/           # walk for test files
  file: src/auth.py      # just this source file

Files listed under "file" are classified as source or test using language
patterns (e.g., test_*.py, *_test.go). This works with any project layout:

  # Tests alongside source
  file: [auth.py, test_auth.py]

  # Separate test directory
  file: [src/auth.py, tests/test_auth.py]

  # Walk a directory + specific files
  path: tests/
  file: [src/auth.py, src/session.py]

Key rules:
- "path" walks a directory tree for all matching files
- "file" includes exactly the files listed (no walking)
- subsections use "path" or "file", not both
- shared behaviors are referenced by name in a section's "shared" list
- both "path" and "file" accept a string or list: "path: foo" or "path: [foo, bar]"

## Writing Behaviors

A behavior IS:
- One observable external behavior with input -> output
- Error cases included inline: "Returns 401 on invalid credentials"
- Side effects stated: "Writes session to database"

A behavior is NOT:
- A data structure ("Report contains these fields")
- An interface definition ("Provider must implement Complete()")
- A list of values ("Supports Go, Python, Java")
- Implementation details ("Uses bcrypt for hashing")

Be specific: "returns 401" not "handles errors". Use kebab-case names.

## Understanding Reports

### Check Report (.vex/report.json)

  {
    "behaviors_checked": 10,
    "gaps": [
      {
        "behavior": "login",
        "detail": "No test for invalid credentials returning 401",
        "suggestion": "TestLoginInvalidCredentials401"
      }
    ],
    "covered": [
      {
        "behavior": "login",
        "detail": "Valid credentials return JWT",
        "test_file": "auth_test.go",
        "test_name": "TestLoginSuccess"
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total_behaviors": 10,
      "fully_covered": 7,
      "gaps_found": 5
    }
  }

A behavior can appear in BOTH gaps and covered (partial coverage).
"fully_covered" counts behaviors in covered but NOT in gaps.

### UNSPECIFIED Gaps

If check finds significant code behavior not in the spec, it reports:

  {"behavior": "UNSPECIFIED", "detail": "Rate limiting logic exists but is not in spec"}

Action: add the missing behavior to the spec, then write a test for it.

### Validation Report (.vex/validation.json)

  {
    "complete": false,
    "suggestions": [
      {
        "section": "Auth",
        "behavior_name": "logout",
        "description": "What happens when user logs out",
        "relation": "new"
      }
    ]
  }

"relation" is "new" for missing behaviors or "extends <name>" for
incomplete ones. "remove: not a behavior" flags non-behavioral entries.

## Exit Codes
- 0: clean (no gaps, spec complete)
- 1: gaps or suggestions found
- 2: fatal error (file not found, invalid config)

## Workflow

1. Receive task description
2. Run: vex spec "description"
3. Review .vex/vexspec.yaml — edit if needed
4. Run: vex validate — read .vex/validation.json
5. Address suggestions, repeat step 4 until complete
6. Implement code and tests
7. Run: vex check — read .vex/report.json
8. For each gap: write the missing test
9. Repeat steps 7-8 until exit code 0

On subsequent changes, use drift to skip unchanged sections:

  vex check --drift

## Adding to an Existing Spec

Append new sections:
  vex spec "Add billing with Stripe integration"

Add behaviors to an existing section:
  vex spec "Add password reset flow" --extend Auth

## Commands
  vex check                          # full check
  vex check --section "Name"         # check one section
  vex check --drift                  # only check changed sections
  vex validate                       # validate spec completeness
  vex spec "description"             # generate spec sections
  vex spec "desc" --extend "Name"    # add to existing section
  vex drift                          # show which sections changed
  vex init                           # create vex.yaml config
  vex guide                          # print this guide

## Output Files
- .vex/vexspec.yaml    — project spec (source of truth, committed to git)
- .vex/report.json     — check report (gaps + covered)
- .vex/validation.json — validation results
- .vex/drift.json      — drift detection results

IMPORTANT: Always read the full report from these files.
Stdout output may be truncated by your environment.
